# Project Title: GPT-Optimized PDF Reader with Mind-Mapping and Example Sentence Generation 

This project aims to redefine the way users interact with PDF files by implementing a feature-rich, AI-optimized PDF reader with the capability of generating and exporting mind maps, and providing example sentences on-demand. 

## Product Description

Our PDF reader uses cutting-edge NLP technology from OpenAI's GPT models to greatly enhance the reading and learning experience. This is not just a PDF reader, but a comprehensive tool that will change how you consume information.

### PDF Browsing, Reading, and Annotation

This software allows users to browse, read, and annotate PDFs with a user-friendly interface and a broad range of tools. Users can easily highlight text, add notes, and even extract text from the PDF for further reference.

### Mind Map Generation

Our reader is equipped with a unique AI feature that generates a mind map from the PDF text. This feature scans the text and identifies the main ideas and their corresponding details, structuring them into a clear, visually engaging mind map. The generated mind maps can be exported for future reference or sharing.

### Contextual Example Sentences

Furthermore, the software offers a one-of-a-kind function to generate example sentences based on the clicked nodes in the mind map. This helps users understand the context and practical application of ideas, fostering a deeper understanding of the content.

### Built on ChatGPT

This reader is developed on the powerful ChatGPT model. By harnessing the capabilities of this model, we have created a reader that understands and processes text at an advanced level, offering an unparalleled reading experience.

## Usage 

To start using the software, simply import your PDF files into the reader. You can then start reading, annotating, and leveraging the AI capabilities to generate mind maps and example sentences.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from the community. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please follow the guidelines provided in the 'CONTRIBUTING.md' file.

The goal of this project is to revolutionize the way we interact with PDF files and provide a tool that enhances the reading and learning experience. We hope this tool will become a valuable addition to your reading, studying, and information gathering toolkit.
